# Global Stock Market Dashboard

**Short description**
A responsive single-page dashboard (Streamlit) that visualizes global stock price data (monthly variation, top & bottom companies, locations on a map, and animated price fluctuations). The app can load your own `World Stock Prices (Daily Updating)` CSV from Kaggle or use a built-in sample for demonstration.

---

## Features

* Monthly price variation (bar chart)
* Top **K** companies by average close (doughnut / pie)
* Bottom **K** companies by average close (doughnut / pie)
* Map (Leaflet/Folium) to show HQ locations of top companies
* Animated chart showing daily fluctuations for top N companies
* Filters: month and industry
* CSV upload support and filtered data download

## Dataset

This project expects the **World Stock Prices (Daily Updating)** dataset from Kaggle.
ðŸ“Œ Dataset URL: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/world-stock-prices-daily-updating](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/world-stock-prices-daily-updating)

It contains daily historical stock data per brand including Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, Stock Splits, Brand_Name, Ticker, Industry_Tag, Country, and location coordinates (lat/lon). Use this dataset (or any similarly structured CSV) as input for the dashboard.

If you prefer to download from the command line (Kaggle CLI):

```bash
# requires kaggle CLI configured (https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
kaggle datasets download -d nelgiriyewithana/world-stock-prices-daily-updating
unzip world-stock-prices-daily-updating.zip
```
